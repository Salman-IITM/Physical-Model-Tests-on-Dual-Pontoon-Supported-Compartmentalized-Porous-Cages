The videos and Excel sheet provided here are associated with experiments conducted in the glass flume laboratory at IIT Madras by research scholar Mr. Salman Shah, under the supervision of Dr. Vijay K. G.

A series of physical model tests were conducted on dual pontoon-supported compartmentalized porous cages under various wave regimes. Scattering coefficients and trapped elevations were measured. An in-house developed code based on dual boundary integral equations was validated against the experimental test results. For detailed configuration nomenclature and comprehensive results, interested parties are directed to:
